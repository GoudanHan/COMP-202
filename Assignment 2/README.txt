For First Half:

I've told a student about how to get full credits in this assignment and taught her how to write some of the helper functions.

I've also told another student how to write the raisedpos_to_binary(s) function.

For Second Half:

In Part 5, I don't know how to put ⠼ in front of the first digit and the ⠰ at the end of the digit. So any doctests related to digits in english_text_to_braille() has failed. 

This is the problem I ran into when I was doing the second half (which is part 5) of the assignment.
